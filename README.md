# DiamantinoCraft-1.15.2
Compatibility
This mod uses FE(Forge Energy), any mod that uses FE should be compatible.

Blocks
You can add recipes for any machine using data packs, even machines that work with fluids! All recipes go in the recipes folder, same as crafting recipes.
All ores can be disabled in the config file (in the config folder).

 

    Alloy Smelter - Smelts multiple items into a single item, like copper and tin into bronze.
    Battery Box - Stores energy. Capacity can be increased by added more batteries to the box.
    Coal Generator - Generates energy from burnable items (furnace fuels) coal, charcoal, and coal blocks (additional items can be tagged as valid fuels).
    Compressor - Squeezes items into other items.
    Crusher - Crushes/grinds items, like ores into ore chunks and ore chunks into dust. Up to four outputs per recipes, with the option to add a chance of receiving certain items.
    Drying Rack - Turns meat to jerky and rotten flesh into leather, among other things. Additional recipes can be added.
    Electric Furnace - Can smelt anything a blast furnace or a furnace can.
    Lava Generator - Generates energy from lava. Has an input/output slot for fluid containers if fluid pipes are not available.

Items

This mod adds a wide range of items, such as crushed ore chunks, dusts, ingots, and nuggets.

 

    Canisters - Stackable fluid containers, useful for transporting large amounts of fluid. Fluid machines will accept these just like buckets, but they may not work with other mods.
    Jerky - A food item made with drying racks
    Wrench - Used to configure wires. Can also rotate some blocks when sneaking.
    Zombie Leather - Made with drying racks, craft four together to make one leather

 

Notes

Not all blocks have proper textures yet. If you see a block with a plain texture with a letter on it, the texture is a placeholder but the block still functions. If a block is missing its model entirely (purple/black checkboard), it likely does not function yet.

This mod currently does not offer fluid/item pipes. Hoppers should interact with most blocks correctly. Fluids can be transferred with buckets or canisters.
